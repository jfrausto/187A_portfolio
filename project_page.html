          This site is an intelligent design that utilizes print press style aesthetics. The
          big emblem serves to give a great feel for this print press style. All important
          information/links are kept above the fold in a very nice naviation bar. Most of the
          screen real estate is taken up by this scrolling gallery that moves on its own. This gallery
          serves to be really functional and is really interactive to the user because it
          gives information efficiently and elegantly. Below the fold, there are other helpful
          but less important links and information.

          KAVOON immediately lets the user know that they are a quirky web design group when one of the
          first messages you can see is "Can you resist KAVOON?" with a giant watermelon star. The logo
          communicates a technical flavor with its pixelated logo and the featured watermelon graphic in
          space. It emphasizes the graphic with a nice text wrap all around. There is a small but visible
          side navigation bar that remains constant along with the watermelon graphic thoughout this websites
          pages. Contact information has its own page along with a convinient footer throughout as well.
          Overall, the brand communicates really well and serves to be very functional in delivering
          relevant information.

            The first thing that stands out in this porfolio is the theme of the page. If you view the page
            during daylight hours, a nice orange and green layout flips on and it gives the feeling of daytime.
            If viewed during the night, the night takes a dark blue and white theme that resembles the night.
            This aspect of the page is very interactive as you can also manually change the theme.
            One way this page is inconsistent is in its backgrounds when you click a different tab on the nav
            bar, a different background shows up. One way it IS consistent in in the constant top nav bar.
            The page seems to be very minimalistic but with a purpose to show off the backgrounds and style
            of the designers. Not very cluttered, but efficient.

            <br>
            This portfolios most striking feature is the fluidity of the site. Everything seems to
            animated and in a fluid motion, from the scrolling horizontal gallery to the "go to top" button
            that follows you as you scroll down. Even the background moves slightly. The navigation bar
            is consistent throughout the site as well as the sleek black theme. Everything is fully functional
            and communicates well to any first time viewer. Most important stuff is kept above the fold while
            lesss important contact links are kept below the fold. Very basic layout, just executed very well
            with beautfiful embellishments with css and javascript.
